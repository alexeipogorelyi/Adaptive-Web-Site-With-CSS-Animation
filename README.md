# Adaptive-Web-Site-With-CSS-Animation
Adaptively designed site with CSS animation

CSS animation: when opening the site, after 3 seconds all the icons move out from under the green bar, one by one with a delay of 0.4 seconds each, after all the flags are in their places, they begin to endlessly rotate clockwise, passing under the photo of the girl.

Limits on input in the search field have also been set:
1. the number of characters to enter in the search field:
Minimum 4 characters.
Maximum 12 characters.
2. limitation on the input of these characters:
`!@#$%^&*()`
All other characters are allowed to be entered.

The description under the header is loaded via ajax request from a third-party service.
